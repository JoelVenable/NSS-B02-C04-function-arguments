## Practice: Function Arguments

> The learning objective of this exercise is to practice defining and using function arguments.

Add a new argument to the function so that a developer can specify which character should be displayed instead of it always being an exclamation point.

```js
// I want to use a question mark
addExcitement(sentence, "?")
```

> **Example output:**
>
> The
>
> The walrus
>
> The walrus danced?
>
> The walrus danced? through
>
> The walrus danced? through the
>
> The walrus danced? through the trees?
>
> The walrus danced? through the trees? in
>
> etc..
